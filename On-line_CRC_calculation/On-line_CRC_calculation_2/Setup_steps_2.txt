Use Modbus Poll 
1 Open the Modbus Poll and set the parameters
1 Set the start address and quantity (register) 
2 This is the channel 1 voltage  = 4.01v
2 This is the channel 2 voltage  = 3.99v
3 CH3)C1 Current value   = 0.00MA
4 CH4)C2 Current value   = 0.00MA

(CH1)V1 voltage ratio = 1000

This value can be corrected when the voltage/Current reading deviation is greater than 1%, such as:
1000 means 1:1
1010: 1% increase
990: 1% decrease


Modify the baud rate (repower on)  4:19200 repower on
Modify Slave ID  = 2

It can be used as a reference video for all RS485 devices of the eletechsup brand, such as:
N4DAC02  N4DBA06 N4IOA01 N46IB02  R4AVA07
